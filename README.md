Welcome to my **personal profile website**! This is my first web development project, created to practice and showcase my skills in **HTML** and **CSS**. It includes a centered profile image, personal introduction, and contact links to my GitHub and Gmail.
This project is a simple, static website that serves as my personal profile. Itâ€™s built to:
- Learn the basics of HTML and CSS
- Understand how to structure a webpage
- Practice using external icons like Font Awesome
- Showcase a profile photo and contact information
 Clean and centered layout using **Flexbox**
- Profile image in the center of the screen
- GitHub and Gmail icons at the bottom for contact
- Responsive design for small screens
- Hover effects on icons for interactivity

NB// The project is unfinished due to time or due date I am pleased to excercise my skills and knowledge in future thanks to PLP HACKTHONS
